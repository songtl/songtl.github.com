Everybody’s Fine，一部公路电影，国内译为《天伦之旅》。

电影讲述一个年老的父亲，妻子过世。他期盼着儿女回家聚会，迎来的却是儿女一个个不能赴约的消息。面对着空荡荡的房间，老父亲带上行李箱，在不同城市间穿梭，踏上了拜访四个孩子的旅途。

随着年龄的增长，一些传统节日的氛围似乎淡了。中秋不吵着要吃月饼了，春节不跟着屁股要红包了，点鞭炮放烟花的热情也不知道哪里去了！于是回家过节的欲望也没那么强烈了！

应该庆幸看到这部电影是在中秋前，仔细想想，已经有好几年没在家过中秋了，毕业以后出去工作后回去的机会更少，于是决定买票回去和家人一起过个中秋。

虽然坐了几天的车很累，不过现在想来，中秋这么一个团圆的节日，不管月亮圆不圆，月饼大不大，和家人坐在一起聊聊天的感觉总是极好的！

片尾曲：I want to come home –Paul McCartney

 
For so long I was out in the cold,  
and I taught myself to believe every story I told.  
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun,  
but it’s been too long. Now I wanna come home.

Came so close to the edge of defeat.  
But I made my way in the shade, keeping out of the heat.  
It was fun shooting out of the stars, looking into the sun,  
but it’s been too long. Now I wanna come home.

Home. Where’s there’s nothing but sweet surrender,  
to the memories from afar.  
Home. To the place where the truth lies waiting,  
we remember who we are.

For too long I was out on my own.  
Every day I spent trying to prove I could make it alone.  
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun,  
but it’s been too long. Now I wanna come home.  
Home.

For so long I was out in the cold,  
but I taught myself to believe every story I told.  
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun,  
but it’s been too long. Now I wanna come home.  
Yeah, it’s been too long, now I want to come home.  
Been too long, now I want to come home.

我们都是迷失的一群，我们一直在寻找回家的路！ ——《Everybody’s fine》影评
